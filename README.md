# ConnectFour
This little project consists of implementing a console-playable adaptation of the game called "Connect Four". The board can have a size from 5x5 to 9x9 and there can be multiple games or a single game. When a player wins a game, they get 2 points, while if it's a draw, each player get 1 point. This project was guided by a hyperskill.org kotlin project.
